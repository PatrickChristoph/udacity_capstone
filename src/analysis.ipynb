    "\n",
    "There are four data files associated with this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Udacity_AZDIAS_052018.csv`: Demographics data for the general population of Germany; 891 211 persons (rows) x 366 features (columns).\n",
    "- `Udacity_CUSTOMERS_052018.csv`: Demographics data for customers of a mail-order company; 191 652 persons (rows) x 369 features (columns).\n",
    "- `Udacity_MAILOUT_052018_TRAIN.csv`: Demographics data for individuals who were targets of a marketing campaign; 42 982 persons (rows) x 367 (columns).\n",
    "- `Udacity_MAILOUT_052018_TEST.csv`: Demographics data for individuals who were targets of a marketing campaign; 42 833 persons (rows) x 366 (columns).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row of the demographics files represents a single person, but also includes information outside of individuals, including information about their household, building, and neighborhood. Use the information from the first two files to figure out how customers (\"CUSTOMERS\") are similar to or differ from the general population at large (\"AZDIAS\"), then use your analysis to make predictions on the other two files (\"MAILOUT\"), predicting which recipients are most likely to become a customer for the mail-order company.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"CUSTOMERS\" file contains three extra columns ('CUSTOMER_GROUP', 'ONLINE_PURCHASE', and 'PRODUCT_GROUP'), which provide broad information about the customers depicted in the file. The original \"MAILOUT\" file included one additional column, \"RESPONSE\", which indicated whether or not each recipient became a customer of the company. For the \"TRAIN\" subset, this column has been retained, but in the \"TEST\" subset it has been removed; it is against that withheld column that your final predictions will be assessed in the Kaggle competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, all of the remaining columns are the same between the three data files. For more information about the columns depicted in the files, you can refer to two Excel spreadsheets provided in the workspace. [One of them](./DIAS Information Levels - Attributes 2017.xlsx) is a top-level list of attributes and descriptions, organized by informational category. [The other](./DIAS Attributes - Values 2017.xlsx) is a detailed mapping of data values for each feature in alphabetical order.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the below cell, we've provided some initial code to load in the first two datasets. Note for all of the `.csv` data files in this project that they're semicolon (`;`) delimited, so an additional argument in the [`read_csv()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html) call has been included to read in the data properly. Also, considering the size of the datasets, it may take some time for them to load completely.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice when the data is loaded in that a warning message will immediately pop up. Before you really start digging into the modeling and analysis, you're going to need to perform some cleaning. Take some time to browse the structure of the data and look over the informational spreadsheets to understand the data values. Make some decisions on which features to keep, which features to drop, and if any revisions need to be made on data formats. It'll be a good idea to create a function with pre-processing steps, since you'll need to clean all of the datasets before you work with them."

Each of the rows in the \"MAILOUT\" data files represents an individual that was targeted for a mailout campaign. Ideally, we should be able to use the demographic information from each individual to decide whether or not it will be worth it to include that person in the campaign.\n",
